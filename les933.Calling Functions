Here's the same program for left_turn except 
the function call is now above the function definition:

from turtle import *

# This is the function call.
left_turn()

# This is the function definition 
def left_turn():
    for i in range(10): 
        forward(15)
        left(9)

bye()
--
What do you think the program will output?,  The program will cause an error.
--
The function definition must be above the function call, otherwise the program will get an error:
from turtle import *

# This is the function call.
left_turn()

# This is the function definition 
def left_turn():
    for i in range(10): 
        forward(15)
        left(9)

bye()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
NameError: name 'left_turn' is not defined

The order of commands is very important when writing programs.
----
Let's say we wanted to draw a semi-circle using the left_turn command we just defined.
What do you think this program will output?
from turtle import *

def left_turn(): 
    for i in range(10):
        left(9)     
        forward(15) 
left_turn() 
left_turn() 

bye()
That's correct!
This program will call left_turn twice to draw a semi-circle:
-------
One of the great powers of functions is that they're 
reusable â€” define it once, and call it as many times as desired.
---
For instance, we can draw a full circle by calling left_turn four times:
from turtle import *

def left_turn(): 
    for i in range(10):
        left(9)     
        forward(15) 

left_turn() 
left_turn() 
left_turn()
left_turn()

bye()
