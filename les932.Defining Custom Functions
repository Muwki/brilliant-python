Defining Custom Functions
One of the most powerful programming tools is writing custom functions.
These share many of the features of built-in functions but are completely customizable.
Let's explore them by returning to turtle drawings.

So instead of writing
for i in range(10):
    forward(15)
    left(9)
we could just write this:
left_turn()
Suppose we want to teach the turtle a 
left_turn command that runs this code:

from turtle import *

for i in range(10):
    forward(15)
    left(9)
    
bye()
--
Do you think this program will work?
from turtle import *

left_turn()
    
bye()
No, because the turtle has no way of knowing what left_turn() is supposed to do.
No, because the function left_turn() needs an input.
---
When we run the above program, it outputs an error message:

name 'left_turn' is not defined
This error means that Python doesn't recognize left_turn as the name of either a 
built-in function or one of those imported from the “turtle” module.

To teach the turtle a new function, we need to define it.
Take a look at this code (and the comments). It's called the function definition:

# Defining a custom function named "left_turn"
def left_turn():
    # Start of left_turn's definition 
    for i in range(10): 
        forward(15)
        left(9)
        # End of the for loop 
    # End of left_turn's definition

# Rest of the program below
---------
A function definition always starts with the syntax of 
def, followed by the name of the function, a set of parentheses (), and a colon :.

The code inside the function definition needs to be indented. 
The end of the indentation is the end of the function definition.
-----
What do you think will be the output when we run this program?
# Defining a custom function named "left_turn"
def left_turn():
    # Start of left_turn's definition 
    for i in range(10): 
        forward(15)
        left(9)
        # End of the for loop 
    # End of left_turn's definition

# Rest of the program below
It will draw a part of a circle as defined in left_turn.
----
So far, we have defined the function, 
but we haven't actually called it yet, so nothing will happen.

Once the function has been defined, we can then carry out a function call:
from turtle import *

# This is the function definition 
def left_turn():
    # Start of left_turn's definition 
    for i in range(10): 
        forward(15)
        left(9)
        # End of the for loop 
    # End of left_turn's definition

# This is the function call.
left_turn()
    
bye()
When the function call is executed, it runs the code inside of the function definition.
