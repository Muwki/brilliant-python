Step Size
What do you think will happen if we give range three inputs?
from turtle import *

for i in range(5, 50, 5):
    forward(i)
    left(90)

bye()

It will change the value of i by 5 each time.

That's correct!
The third input to range is the step size — 
how many numbers to jump in between each loop.
So, this program will start with i at 5, 
then next it'll be 10, then 15, and so on until it reaches 50:

Here's a slightly different program:
What will be the first three values of i in this program?

from turtle import *

for i in range(10, 100, 10):
    forward(i)
    left(90)

bye()
In this program, the start value is 10, the stop value is 100, and the step size is 10.
Explanation
When the range function has three inputs, the first is the start value, 
the second is the stop value, and the third input is the step size.
In this program, the start value is 10, the stop value is 100, and the step size is 10:
for i in range(10, 100, 10):
    forward(i)
    left(90)
So the first value of i is the start value, which is 10. 
Then it increases by the step size which is 10, so the next value is 20. Then the third value is 30.

--------
So the first value of i is 10, the next is 20, then 30, and so on:
-------------------
How many times does this program execute the loop?

from turtle import *

for i in range(10, 100, 10):
    forward(i)
    left(90)

bye()

Recall that when the range function has three inputs,
the first is the start value, the second is the stop value, 
and the third input is the step size.

Explanation
Recall that when the range function has three inputs,
the first is the start value,
the second is the stop value, and
the third input is the step size.
The program starts at 10, then steps by 10 between each loop, 
and goes until it reaches 100 (but doesn't include it).
Since the stop value is exclusive, the loop runs 9 times.

-----------
This program starts i with a value of 10, then “steps” 
by 10 between each loop, and stops at 100 but doesn't include it. 
So this loop will run 9 times:

from turtle import *

for i in range(10, 100, 10):
    # Uncomment the line below see value of i
    # print(i) 
    forward(i)
    left(90)

bye()
