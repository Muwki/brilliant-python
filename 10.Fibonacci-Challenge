In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

The sequence starts with 0 and 1. The third term would then be 
0+1=1. Here are the first five terms:
1st: 0
2nd:     1
3rd: 0 + 1 = 1
4th:     1 + 1 = 2 
5th:         1 + 2 = 3

Write a program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence out to the 20th term based on any two starting values.
Here's a starting point for printing out 20 numbers. Be careful to use the same spacing to indent everything inside of the loop.

Complete the program so that it outputs the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
With a as the number from two steps ago and b as the last number, 
the sequence is followed by having each loop calculate c = a + b then updating a and b
â€” making sure to update a before b, otherwise a would use b's updated value instead of its old value.

a = 0
print(a)
b = 1
print(b)
for i in range(18):
    c = a + b # next term
    print(c)
    a = b     # update 2 previous terms
    b = c     # update prior term
