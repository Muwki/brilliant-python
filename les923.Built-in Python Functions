Built-in Python Functions
Here is the find command. Take a guess at what you think this program might output:

str1 = "parts"
str2 = "art"
print(str1.find(str2))

The find function is used to locate letters (or words) in a string of text.

---
The command str1.find(str2) gives the first position in str1 
where str2 occurs. Run this code to see for yourself:
str1 = "parts"
str2 = "art"
print(str1.find(str2))
1
--
The code snippet prints 1 because that's the “position” of "art" in "parts".
--
The number we get from str1.find(str2) is called an index — 
a number which describes the position where str2 starts in str1.

The index of an item is determined by its numbered place in a string starting at 0 (not 1):

      parts
      01234
The index of a single character is its number, 
and the index of str2 is the place in str1 where the first character of str2 is found.
---
What index would this code return?
str1 = "Is it going well?" 
str2 = "go"
print(str1.find(str2))

When we write str1.find(str2), we're asking the computer to find 
the first place in str1 where str2 occurs.
In the sentence “Is it going well?”, the string “go” appears for 
the first and only time at the beginning of “going.” 
So, the number we end up with will be the index of the “g” at the beginning of “going.” 
Counting upward from the first character, starting from zero, we find that the index is 6, making that our answer.

Note: For Python, spaces are characters just like letters, 
so we have to count them when we're finding the index of anything in the string.
--
In the code below, the string “go” appears 
at the beginning of “going” which starts at index 6:

str1 = "Is it going well?" 
str2 = "go"
print(str1.find(str2))
6
