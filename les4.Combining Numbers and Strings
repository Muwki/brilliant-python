Combining Numbers and Strings
print("My age is " + 27)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: must be str, not int

Using a + to combine a string and a number results in an error called a TypeError because they are different data types.

The + operator works differently for numbers and strings.

print("My favorite number is " , 65)

Another approach is to use a , to join values and display them.
The input after the , is treated as its own print statement, so it can be used to combine strings and numbers.

Here's another program that uses concatenation.
print("Our combined age is" , 27 + 32)
Our combined age is 59

print("Our combined age is 27" + "32")

print("Our combined age is" , 27 + 32)
Our combined age is 2732
Our combined age is 59

Different data types in Python follow their own rules and need to be treated differently.
