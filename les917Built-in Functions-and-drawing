Built-in Functions
In previous lessons, we learned about the forward and left commands, 
which are known as functions. In this lesson, we'll explore a few more functions.

Let's revisit the program to draw a square from the last lesson.
What do you think will happen if we change the command on line 3 
from color('blue') to color('dark turquoise')?

from turtle import *

color('dark turquoise') # color('blue')
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)

The color command controls the color of the Turtle. 
Python knows a number of colors that can go in the parentheses of the color command.

Python has many colors to choose from, including dark turquoise. 
Try picking another color from this list to change the color of 
the square in the program above.

What color do you think the left side of the square will be in this program?

from turtle import *

color('dark turquoise')
forward(200)
left(90)
color('fuchsia')
forward(200)
left(90)
color('deep sky blue')
forward(200)
left(90)
color('hot pink')
forward(200)

It'll be hot pink.

The color function sets the color of all lines drawn after it,
until the color is changed again.

The left side of the square is the 4th line drawn, 
and as specified in line 12, it'll be “hot pink.” Check it out below:
---
from turtle import *

color('dark turquoise') # set color to 'dark turquoise'
forward(200) # bottom of square
left(90)
color('fuchsia') # set color to 'fuchsia'
forward(200) # right side of square
left(90)
color('deep sky blue') # set color to 'deep sky blue'
forward(200) # top of square
left(90)
color('hot pink') # set color to 'hot pink'
forward(200) # left side of square

multi-colored triangle:
What color will the left side of the triangle be in this program?
from turtle import *

color('purple') # Set color to Purple
forward(200) 
left(120)
color('blue') # Set color to Blue
forward(200) 
color('magenta') # Set color to Magenta
left(120)
color('red') # Set color to Red
forward(200) # Left side of triangle

bye()

Is any part of the above drawing magenta? no
That's correct!

The turtle does change its color to magenta on line 8, 
but it changes the color to red before drawing the last line, 
so there's no magenta in the outputted drawing.

However, if you look very closely, 
the turtle is magenta when it turns left at the top of the triangle.
