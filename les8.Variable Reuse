Variable Reuse
Let's dive deeper into how variables work and what they're capable of.
Here's a simple program that sets a message variable and then uses print to display it.

message = "Hi, I'm learning Python"
print(message)
Hi, I'm learning Python

message = "Hi I'm Joe"
message = "I'm a lifelong learner"
message = "I'm learning to code"
print(message)
I'm learning to code

The value stored in a variable can change throughout a program. When that variable is called,
the program uses the most recently assigned value.

num = 3
num = num + 2
num = num * 2 
print(num)
10

num = 3
num = num + num
num = num * 2 
print(num)
12
A variable can be updated using its current value.

Clever reuse of variables can make for much shorter programs.
