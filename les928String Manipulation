String Manipulation
Another way to slice strings is to access every character before or after an index.
You can access every character after the starting index by leaving out the ending index.

To get “equivocal” from the string "Unequivocal" stored in str1, you can just write str1[2:]:

str1 = "Unequivocal"
str2 = str1[2:]
print(str2)
equivocal
--
Similarly, we can get every character before 
the selected index by leaving out the starting index:

str1 = "Goldfish"
str2 = str1[:4]
print(str2)
Gold
---
str1 = "Goldfish"
str2 = str1[4:]
print(str2)
fish
--
Explanation
The string “fish” starts at index 5 and continues to the end of the string,
so you can simply write str1[4:] to extract the substring.

In combination, find and slicing open up many new possibilities to manipulate strings.
