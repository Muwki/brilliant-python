Drawing New Shapes
This program draws a 5-sided star pentagon.

----
the fill commmand
As a new feature, you might have noticed that 
this program shows how a turtle can draw filled shapes.
The color command determines the fill color, 
and whatever code is in-between begin_fill() and end_fill() is what gets filled in.
---
from turtle import *
speed(5)
width(5)

color('red', 'yellow') # Two inputs: a stroke color and a fill color.

begin_fill() # Start of a filled shape.
for i in range(5): # Repeat 5 times
    # The turning angle is chosen so that the star closes in on itself after five turns.
    right(180 - 36) # Turning angle 
    forward(200)
end_fill() # Fills in the shape it has been drawing

Modify this program so that it draws a star heptagram, or 7-sided star:

What should line 8 be changed to so that we draw 7 sides instead of 5?

from turtle import *
speed(5)
width(5)

color('red', 'yellow') 

begin_fill() 
for i in range(5):
    right(180 - 36) 
    forward(200)
end_fill() 
    
hideturtle()
bye()

To create a 7-sided star, we need to make 7 turns instead of 5:
----
To create a 7-sided star, we need to make 7 turns instead of 5. 
To do that, we change the number of times the turtle loops to 7.
----
from turtle import *
speed(5)
width(5)

color('red', 'yellow')

begin_fill()
for i in range(7):  # Changed to range(7)
    right(180 - 36)
    forward(200)
end_fill()
    
hideturtle()

The turning angle was based on a 5-sided star, and now needs to be updated for a 7-sided star.
---
Which command could be inserted in line 9 in the program above to draw a 7-sided star?
--
The right turning angle for a 7-sided star is
                                                 180∘ − 180∘/7,
which you can try out yourself. There are number of solutions that would work since:
                                                 180 ∘/ 7 ≈25.7 and 180∘ - 25.7∘ 154.3∘.

The other answer choices would only work for stars with fewer sides.

Here's our 7-sided star:
from turtle import *
speed(5)
width(5)

color('red', 'yellow')

begin_fill()
for i in range(7):  # Changed to 7
    right(180 - 180/7) # Updated for 7 sides
    forward(200)
end_fill()
    
hideturtle()
bye()

These functions, together with for-loops and simple math, 
allow us to draw all kinds of beautiful shapes and patterns.
