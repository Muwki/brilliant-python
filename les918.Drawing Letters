Drawing Letters
In the next programs, 
we'll incorporate new functions that will help the turtle to draw letters.

This program draws the letter D.
from turtle import *

width(5) 
left(90)   
forward(200)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(45)
forward(71)
right(45)
forward(100) 
right(45)
forward(71)
right(45)
forward(100)
hideturtle()

bye()
----------
What do you think would happen 
if we changed command width(5) to width(50) on line 3?
--
The command width controls the thickness of the turtle's pen, 
so changing the input from 5 to 50 means that the pen will be much thicker than before:

from turtle import *

width(50) # changed to 50
left(90)   
forward(200)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(45)
forward(71)
right(45)
forward(100) 
right(45)
forward(71)
right(45)
forward(100)
hideturtle()

bye()
---
Here's the same program with the width(50) command added to line 7:
from turtle import *

width(5) 
left(90)   
forward(200)
right(90)
width(50) # line added 
forward(100)
right(45)
forward(71)
right(45)
forward(100) 
right(45)
forward(71)
right(45)
forward(100)
hideturtle()

bye()

Just like the color command, the width command determines the thickness of everything drawn after it.

In this program, the width is initially set to 5 on line 3 before the straight line of the 
D is drawn. Then the width is updated to 50 on line 7, 
which controls the thickness of the rest of the D
