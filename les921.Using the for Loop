Using the for Loop
Let's practice using the for loop.

Here's the previous program that draws a 
C using a for loop:

from turtle import *
width(5)

left(180) # Orient the Turtle

for i in range(5):
    forward(50)
    left(45)  # Turning angle

hideturtle()
bye()
------
In the program above, how many times does the turtle turn inside of the loop?
After the initial left turn in line 4, the command left(45) gets repeated 5 times over. 
So the turtle turns a total of 6 times, but only 5 times in the loop. The last turn happens at the lower end of the C

Since the turtle doesn't move afterward, we don't see it in the final image. You would see it if you disabled hideturtle().
The turtle makes 5 turns of 45 degrees in the for loop to draw a C.
---------
How many times would the program need to loop 
to make the turtle complete a round trip and draw the letter O?

from turtle import *
width(5)

left(180)

for i in range(5):
    forward(50)
    left(45)

hideturtle()
bye()
---
How could line 6 in the above program be changed 
to draw an O without retracing any of its steps?

The turtle is turning in increments of 45 degrees,
which makes it draw a regular octagon. So, after 8 turns (8 repetitions of the loop), 
it ends back where it started.

Increasing the range to 9 or 10 would also draw an O,
but the turtle would retrace it steps in the process.
--------
To complete the letter O and draw a full 360 degrees, 
the for loop should turn 45 degrees 8 times, or 360 degrees.

from turtle import *
width(5)

left(180)

for i in range(8):
    forward(50)
    left(45)

hideturtle()
bye()

Our last drawings had very jagged edges.
---
This program draws a smooth curve by joining segments of 
length 10 px while turning by a small angle 3 degrees between them:

from turtle import *
width(5)

for i in range(20):
    forward(10)
    left(3)

bye()
---
In the program above, by what angle does the turtle turn in total?, 60 degrees
for i in range(20):
    forward(10)
    left(3)
--
The turtle turns by 3 degrees twenty times over, 
so overall it has turned by 20 times 3 degrees, or 60 degrees.
