Drawing with Loops
This program directs a turtle that draws a line. 
It's attempting to draw the letter C, 
but the turning angle inputted to the left commands need to be adjusted:
---
from turtle import *
width(5)

left(180) # Orients the Turtle left

forward(50)
left(10)    # Turning angle
forward(50)
left(10)    # Turning angle
forward(50)
left(10)    # Turning angle
forward(50)
left(10)    # Turning angle
forward(50)

hideturtle()
bye()
---
What range is appropriate for the turning angle inputted to draw a C?

Try out various angles as arguments for left — lines 7, 9, 11, and 13 — 
but the same in each line. If you start at 10 degrees and increase the angle by 10 degrees
each time, you'll see that for 40 and 50 degrees, a letter C
can be recognized. Angles below 40 or above 50 make the letter look unnatural or unrecognizable:
---
To figure out the proper angle, the best way is to guess and check with the inputs for left — lines 7, 9, 11, and 13:

from turtle import *
width(5)

left(180)

forward(50)
left(45)    # Turning angle
forward(50) 
left(45)    # Turning angle
forward(50)
left(45)    # Turning angle
forward(50) 
left(45)    # Turning angle
forward(50) 

hideturtle()
bye()

For angles between 40 and 50 degrees, a letter C can be recognized.
Editing the turning angle in four different places sure is tedious.

Here's a more compact version of the previous program that uses a for loop. 
Read the program's comments, and then run it:

from turtle import *
width(5)

left(180)

# Start of for loop.
for i in range(5): # Code below is repeated 5 times
    # Code to be repeated 
    forward(50) # Indentation indicates code is inside the loop
    left(45) # Still inside the for loop
# No more indentation! Marks the end of the for-loop.
hideturtle()
bye()
Remember that i and range on line 7 determine how many times the loop will repeat.
------
The commands forward(100) and left(45) will be repeated 5 times over. The for loop
for i in range(5):
    forward(100)
    left(45)

is therefore shorthand for this:
forward(100)
left(45)
forward(100)
left(45)
forward(100)
left(45)
forward(100)
left(45)
forward(100)
left(45)
---
A couple of reminders about working with for loops:
The number that we put inside range() in the line for i in range(5) 
is what determines the number of times the loop will repeat.
Only the code that's indented below the for loop will be repeated (or “looped” over).
Code inside the for loop needs to be indented in a consistent way.
The end of the indentation marks the end of the for loop.
