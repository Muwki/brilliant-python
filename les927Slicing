Slicing

How can you print the substring “love” in this program?

Update line 2 to find the substring of str1 to print “love”

str1 = "What lovely weather we're having!"
str2 = str1[5:9] # Updated to extract "love"
print(str2) 

To extract "love" from str1", we first need to find the starting and ending 
indices of this substring. 
The letter "l" first appears at index 5, and the word love is 4
characters long, so we know that str2 = str1[5:9].
--
The letter "l" first appears at index 5 
and the word love is 4 characters long, so we know that str2 = str1[5:9]:
--
str1 = "What lovely weather we're having!"
str2 = str1[5:9] # Updated to extract "love"
print(str2) 
love
--
Here we're starting with a string in str1 and then copying 
the substring between two indices into another variable, str2. This is known as slicing.

Let's say that str1 = "scrumptious".
We then write print(str1[i:j]), where both i and j are integers:
--
original = scrumptious
slice    =  crump
--
If the computer prints "crump" as a result, what are the values of i and j?

str1 = "scrumptious"
# What numbers should be filled in? 
i = ?
j = ? 
str2 = str1[i:j]
print(str2) # Output: "crump"

explination
To extract "crump" from "scrumptious", 
we first need to find the starting and ending indices of this substring. 
These will be the index of "c" and the index of "p" plus 1, respectively.

By counting up from 0, we find that these indices are 1 and 5 + 1 = 6. 
So, using the syntax we saw in the previous pane, 
the numbers we need to put in the brackets are i = 1 and j = 5 + 1 = 6.
