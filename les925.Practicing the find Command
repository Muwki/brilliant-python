Practicing the find Command
Gauge your understanding of 
the find command with the programs below:
What do you think will be the output of this program?

test_string = "tested, testing, tests, test"
print(test_string.find("sted")) 
--
The string “sted” is contained in “tested,” 
so the program outputs the index 2.
--
The string “sted” is contained in “tested,” so the program returns 2:
--
test_string = "tested, testing, tests, test"
print(test_string.find("sted")) 
2
-----
What do you think will be the output of this program?
test_string = "tested, testing, tests, test"
print(test_string.find("tess"))

Each of the characters of “tess” appear individually in “tests,”
but not as a single chunk, so we get -1.

Each of the characters of “tess” appear individually in the test_string, 
but never as a single chunk, so the program returns -1:

test_string = "tested, testing, tests, test"
print(test_string.find("tess"))
-1

Explanation
The string “test” is at the very start of test_string, so the position returned is zero.

The string “test” shows up four times in the test_string. However, 
the find function returns the first instance of the string we are looking for. 
So, in this program, it'll return 0:
--
test_string = "tested, testing, tests, test"
print(test_string.find("test")) 
0
--
The find function is useful if you're looking for a specific set of characters in a string,
but since it only returns the first instance of the search term, it has limited functionality.

If we wanted to find the other occurrences of test in the above program,
we would have to use other functions like count and rstring.
