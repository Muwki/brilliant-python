Operations with Variables
number = 7
print(number + number)
14
The value in the variable number is added to itself and the result is displayed.

Variables can store all different data types, including strings and numbers.

num = 7
message = "My favorite number is "
print(message + num)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in <module>
TypeError: must be str, not int

In this program, one variable stores a number and another stores a string 
so it will result in the same error as any program that tries to combine numbers and strings.

Variables are simply placeholders, so they behave according to the rules of the data type they contain.

num = 7
message = "My favorite number is "
print(message , num)
My favorite number is 7
