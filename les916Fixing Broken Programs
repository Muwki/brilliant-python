Fixing Broken Programs
The program below is supposed to draw only half a square, 
where the turtle draws two sides and returns to its starting point like this:
However, something's wrong with this code. Can you figure out which line is the problem?

from turtle import *

color('blue')
forward(200)
left(90) # Option A
forward(200) # Option B
left(45) # Option C
forward(282) # Option D

bye()

What line needs to be fixed so that 
the turtle faces its starting point and draws half a square?
--
After drawing the vertical side on line 6, the turtle is facing up (north). 
To get to its starting point, it must face southwest â€” i.e. 
turn 135 degrees counterclockwise (to the left) on line 7, not 45 degrees to the left.
---
Here's the program running incorrectly. 
See if you can fix line 7 so that it draws half a square as shown above:
---
from turtle import *

color('blue')
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)
left(45)  # Incorrect command
forward(282)

bye()
The correct line should read left(135) to complete the half-a-square drawing.

Here's another test of your understanding:
Can you figure out what this program is drawing?
from turtle import *

color('blue')
forward(200)
left(60)
forward(200)
left(60)
forward(200)

bye()
This time, the turtle is only turning left by 60 degrees instead of 90. 
So the opening angle of the path will actually be wider than for a square.
After three moves and two turns, the turtle has traced out three sides of a regular hexagon.
