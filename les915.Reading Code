Reading Code
Take a look at this program, and try to predict what it'll output:
from turtle import *

color('red')
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)

bye()
output : program draws a square.
----------
Let's unpack each line of code.
In this program, what does the command forward(200) on line 4 do?

The command forward(200) on line 4 
moves the turtle 200 pixels in the direction it's facing,
which is to the right. The turtle always starts facing right.

What does the 90 in the command left(90) on line 5 do?
The command left(90) turns the turtle to the left 
by the number of degrees specified within the parentheses.
In this program, the command left(90) specifies that the turtle 
should be turned 90 degrees to the left:
If the command had been right(90), 
the turtle would have turned 90 degrees to the right instead.
--------------
In the previous programs, you had to predict what each line of the program did. 
Typically, programmers use comments to explain their code 
in plain English so that anyone can understand it.

Here's the previous program, annotated with comments based on what we've learned:

from turtle import * # Loads commands used to draw

color('red') 
forward(200) # Moves the turtle 200 pixels right
left(90) # Turn left 90 degrees
# Turtle is now facing up
forward(200) 
left(90) 
forward(200)
left(90) 
forward(200)

bye() # Tells the turtle we're done writing commands
--------
Comments start with hash sign #. Everything after the # until the end of the line 
is considered a comment and not part of the program, so the program will ignore the text when it runs.
------
What does the command forward(200) on line 6 do?
from turtle import *

color('red')
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200) # What does this do?
left(90)
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(200)

bye()
---
The command forward(200) moves the turtle “forward” in whichever direction it's facing.
On line 6 the turtle is facing up since the Turtle turned 90 degrees to the left on line 5.
Each of the four forward(200) in this program moves the turtle in different directions:
-----
The command forward(200) moves the turtle “forward” in whichever direction it's facing. 
On line 6 the turtle is facing up since the Turtle turned 90 degrees to the left on line 5.
-----
from turtle import * # Loads commands used to draw

color('red') 
forward(200) # Moves the turtle 200 pixels right
left(90) # Turn left 90 degrees, now facing up
forward(200) # Moves the turtle 200 pixels up
left(90) 
forward(200)
left(90) 
forward(200)

bye() # Tells the turtle we're done writing commands.
----
In this program, each of the four forward(200) commands
moves the turtle in different directions.

Here's an annotated version of the program
that we've been exploring that explains what each line does using comments.

from turtle import * # Loads commands used to draw

color('red') # Sets drawing color to red
forward(200) # Moves the turtle 200 pixels forward, i.e. right
left(90) # Turn left 90 degrees
# Turtle is now facing up
forward(200) # Moves 200 pixels forward, i.e. up 
left(90) # Turn left 90 degrees
# Turtle now facing left 
forward(200) # Moves 200 pixels forward, i.e. left
left(90) # Turn left 90 degrees
# Turtle now facing down
forward(200) # Complete bottom of the square

bye() # Tells the turtle we're done writing commands
