The Python Turtle
Let's try Python Turtle drawing, 
where programs control a metaphoric “turtle” that moves around the screen dragging a paintbrush:

Some of the programming concepts will be ideas we've already seen, 
but it can still be helpful to review them in a new context.
Here's a Python Turtle program. Run the code to see how it behaves:
from turtle import *
forward(300)
bye()
output is een ___________________>
> aan het eind is de turtle.
The turtle appears in the animation as a small triangle,
starting in the center and moving.
------
Our drawings are a result of the turtle's movements viewed from above:
----------
The turtle will always be facing east, or to your right, when the program begins. 
The only way for you to get this information was to run the code.
Sometimes there are instructions that you can read to see all the details of 
what a command is supposed to do. Sometimes you just need to experiment to understand what code is doing.
-------
Reading and interpreting code is a difficult but important skill.
Take a look at this code and try to decide on the best English description of what it does:

from turtle import *
forward(200)
left(90)
forward(100)

bye()
--
The Turtle starts facing east, or to the right.

The Turtle will go forward in whichever direction it's facing.
Since the Turtle always starts facing east (or right), 
the English description of the command is that it'll “go forward, to the right.
------------
In English, how would you describe this program?

from turtle import *

forward(200)
left(90)
forward(100)

bye()
output:
Go forward, then turn left, and then go forward by half that distance.
---
The turtle goes east (or right, or forward) at first, by 200 pixels. 
Then she turns to the left by 90 degrees 
(toward the north) so she goes north (forward) by 100 pixels, 
half the distance she went before.

If one of the answers had been “go east (right), 
and then go north by half that distance,” that would have also been correct. 
There's usually more than one way to explain what a piece of code is doing.
----
from turtle import *

forward(200)
left(90)
forward(100)

bye()

Reading code is a difficult skill that we'll practice throughout this course. 
Even the best programmers need time and patience to learn how to read code well.
