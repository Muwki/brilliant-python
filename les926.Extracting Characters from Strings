Extracting Characters from Strings
The find method returns the index of a character (or string) inside a larger string.
To get a string's character at a given index, there's a different syntax.

For instance, let's say that str1 = "educational" 
and we want to access the character at index 4.

We use brackets [] to access or “extract” the character we want:
str1 = "educational"
print(str1[4])
a
---
As a reminder, because indices are counted up from zero, 
index 4 is the fifth position overall, so this program prints a.

What number should we replace 4 with to access the letter n?
str1 = "educational"
print(str1[4])

The characters of a string are indexed starting from 0, 
and the character n is at the ninth position, which is index 8.
-----
Suppose that we've already written this code:
str1 = "annotate"
print(str1[x])

Here, x stands in for a number. 
If we want this code to print the letter o, what value should we replace x with?

In order to extract the letter "o" from "annotate", 
we need to find its index "o" in the string. By counting up from zero 
(or using str.find("o")), we find that its index is 3.

So the proper value for x is 3.
